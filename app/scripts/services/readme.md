## What goes here?
In this folder you should place the code codebase that will start your application and help you manage things along the way. To make this a little easier to start, there are already three files here.
- App.js : This is an object that you can call to get key data for your app.
- AppService.js : This is an object that helps you start your app.
- ComponentRegistry : This is where you can define your custom components.  

## What else do I need before I can code something here?
Nothing other than the problem you need to solve :)

## What should I learn first?
Learn about the basics of JavaScript.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics
- https://www.w3schools.com/js/
- https://www.programiz.com/javascript/get-started

## How might I do that?
Take a look at the three files provided, see what they do and how you might extend them.

## What else might I need to put here?
You might also want to put specific reusable application logic if things are getting too complex in your action handlers.
